## Project Summary

**Project Description:**

The Iris Flower Classification project focuses on developing a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on specific measurements. Iris flowers are classified into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica, each of which exhibits distinct characteristics in terms of measurements.

**Objective:**

The primary goal of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to build a classification model that can accurately identify the species of iris flowers based on their measurements. The model aims to automate the classification process, offering a practical solution for identifying iris species.

**Key Project Details:**

- Iris flowers have three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
- These species can be distinguished based on measurements such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
- The project involves training a machine learning model on a dataset that contains iris flower measurements associated with their respective species.
- The trained model will classify iris flowers into one of the three species based on their measurements.

I have selected recall as the primary evaluation metric for the Iris Flower Classification model. And after removing the overfitted models which have recall, precision, f1 scores for train as 100%, we get the final list:
| Model                     | Recall Train | Recall Test |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Logistic regression       | 0.966387     | 1.000000    |
| Logistic regression tuned | 0.974790     | 1.000000    |
| Decision Tree tuned       | 0.949580     | 0.966667    |
| Random Forest tuned       | 0.966387     | 1.000000    |
| SVM                       | 0.974790     | 1.000000    |

# ðŸ“Œ Conclusion
In the Iris Flower Classification project, we applied multiple machine learning models to predict the species of Iris flowersâ€”Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginicaâ€”based on their sepal and petal measurements. After data preparation, metric-based evaluation, and overfitting analysis, the project led to the selection of the most balanced and generalizable model.

## Data Exploration

The dataset was well-structured with no missing values. Visualizations revealed that Iris-Setosa is linearly separable from the other species, while Versicolor and Virginica had overlapping regions in feature space.

## Data Preprocessing

Since the dataset was clean and numeric, minimal preprocessing was needed. The data was split into training and testing sets, and standard scaling was applied where appropriate.

## Model Evaluation and Overfitting Detection

A wide range of models was evaluated, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and SVMs. For each, we computed core metrics: Precision, Recall, Accuracy, F1 macro, and ROC AUC, on both train and test sets.

## Best Model Selection
Based on Recall as the primary metric (important for minimizing false negatives), the **Logistic Regression (Tuned)** model was selected. It:

* Achieved perfect Recall on the test set

* Maintained high Recall on the training set

* Showed low overfitting and strong generalization

* Is simple, interpretable, and efficient

# âœ… Final Verdict
**The Logistic Regression (Tuned)** model emerged as the optimal classifier, balancing performance and generalization. This project not only met its objectives but also introduced a reusable, clean-coded pipeline for filtering and selecting models â€” laying a strong foundation for similar classification tasks.
